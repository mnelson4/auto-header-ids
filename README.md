# auto-header-ids
WordPress plugin that automatically adds IDs to all headers in posts

Just upload the zip to your WordPress website, and activate the plugin. Then all your post headers (h1, h2, etc) will have an ID tag so you can link directly to them. Plus, when you hover over them, an anchor tag will appear to the side to make that easier.
